                    A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away...

                    A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title. 
                    War drums echo through the heavens as a rollup slowly crawls 
                    into infinity.

                            It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, 
                            striking from a hidden base, have won their first 
                            victory against the evil Galactic Empire.

                            During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal 
                            secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the 
                            Death Star, an armored space station with enough 
                            power to destroy an entire planet.

                            Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess 
                            Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of 
                            the stolen plans that can save her people and 
                            restore freedom to the galaxy...

                    The awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total 
                    eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. A tiny 
                    silver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers 
                    from the back of the ship, races through space. It is pursed 
                    by a giant Imperial Stardestroyer. Hundreds of deadly 
                    laserbolts streak from the Imperial Stardestroyer, causing 
                    the main solar fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate.
